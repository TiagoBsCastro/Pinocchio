[Fri Aug 22 2025 18:20:36] This is pinocchio V5.1, running on 8 MPI tasks

Using 1 OpenMP threads
Using threaded-FFTs
Using 3LPT displacements
Performing PLC construction
Radiation is included in the Friedmann equations
Ellipsoidal collapse will be computed as in Monaco (1995)
Using v5 fragmentation
This version of the code works with scale-dependent growing modes
Scales will range from      0.001 to    31.6228 1/Mpc, in 10 steps
Scale-dependent growth rates will be worked out from CAMB P(k) files
The power spectrum will include only dark matter + baryon fluctuations, excluding neutrinos (if present)
